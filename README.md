# ros_ml_deploy
ros_ml_deploy enables versatile and scalable implementation of processing functionality in ROS contexts. It is aimed towards enabling deployment of machine learning models, but developers are free in the processes they want to implement. It includes automatic setup of ROS topics, publishers, and subscribers from config files for both processing and recording of data.
